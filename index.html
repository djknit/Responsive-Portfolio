                I was born and raised in Manhattan KS. After graduating high school, I moved down the road to Lawrence to become a Jayhawk. In my four years at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, I completed a B.S. in math and a B.A. in chemistry. After graduation, I stayed in Lawrence to pursue my passion for making pizzas. I then left my career in pizza making to develop my skills for moving things around in a warehouse. Despite the naturally rewarding nature of my careers in pizza-making and general warehouse work, I have decided that it is now time to pursue a new career in web development.

                My interests include all things related to math, science, and music. I enjoy coding because it involves the manipulation of precisely defined objects and rules. Because of this, I believe that the types of thought processes required to code successfully are similar to those required to be good at math. I am currently working to establish and sharpen my skills as a web developer. As I continue to build my knowledge of web-based development, I hope to also continue to expand my knowledge to include other areas of software development.
